Android application that runs a local VPN service to bypass DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) and censorship.

The application locally runs [ByeDPI](https://github.com/hufrea/byedpi) and redirects all TCP traffic through it.

## FAQ

### How to get updates?

Use [Obtainium](#or-use-obtainium).

### Is this a VPN?

No. The application uses the VPN mode on Android to redirect traffic, but does not send anything to a remote server. It does not encrypt traffic and does not hide your IP address.

### What data does the application collect?

None. The application does not send any data to a remote server. All traffic is processed on the device.

### Are there any for other platforms?

For Windows, there is [GoodByeDPI](https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI), and for Linux and macOS [zapret](https://github.com/bol-van/zapret). Also, you can use the original [ByeDPI](https://github.com/hufrea/byedpi) to run a similar proxy on Windows, Linux, or macOS.
